Just between us *i'll rather ramble about my favorite lasagna-loving ball of fluffyness*. 
It's probably weird how Garfield still gets me till this day. 
My mum says he is the cartoon version of me. Heck I do not even like lasanga.
Regardless, mother dearest will draw a straight line from me to that cat any day. 
For the purpose of this expository however, i am going to deny knowing why.
Ok, that's probably enough rambling for one night. You wanted to know about me. Let's get to it, shall we?

They call me Ogochukwu, Ogonna and most commonly, Zita *readers bonus;take your pick*. 
I am Nigerian and Igbo by tribe. 
I grew up in the northern part of the country and although it is japa season in this part of the world, i still live here. 
Amazing right? That's what i thought too. 
Now, this is the part where i tell you I like to write, cook, read and make pretty things but in all honesty, i just like really like enjoyment. 
In simple terms, food, money, soft life and zero stress but wishes are not horses so let's stick to the initial three for i actually like those too.

I am a grauduate of sociology, passionate about the girl child and deeply vested in the story of the boy child.
If i were to pick a tag which best describes me, it would be humanist. 

I am interested in software development and currently in training with STUTERN. 
My favorites thing about myself is how I am able to still look at the world through colored lens regardless of the rot.
If i ever get the chance to speak to 12 year old me, i'll say "Dare to dream".

This would be all for now, expect an update in a week or two.
